Docker:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ --> follow the apt repo steps
after that:
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
(this way you don't need sudo for the docker commands, as you add yourself to the docker group)

You also need nvidia-container toolkit to utilize your gpu in the container
https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html --> follow the apt repo steps

You might need to create a daemon.json file if docker does not recognize your gpu (i think they changed something in recent versions as you didn't need this earlier, but now you do)
cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "runtimes": {
    "nvidia": {
       "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
       "runtimeArgs": []
    }
  } 
}

run this:
cd /etc/docker
touch daemon.json
nano daemon.json (es copy-paste ami itt fennt van), utana ctrl+s majd ctrl+x

Nvidia driver is kell a gepen.

Rebootolni se felejts driver install, docker install, nvidia-container toolkit install utan
